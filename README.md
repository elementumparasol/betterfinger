Open source touchpad and clickpad driver for Windows ultrabooks.

The buttonless touchpad, the "clickpad," is a double-edged sword.  While beautiful to look at, it is ultimately difficulty to use.  For powerusers, even the extra quarter second of finger movement on each click can add up to minutes or hours per week in lost productivity.
Clickpad hardware is not usually the problem, rather the lack of quality and consistent drivers.  Manufacturers have a wide range of driver support of their Elan, Synaptics, and other hardware.  Countless netbook and ultrabook reviews across the web suggest using alternate manufacturer's drivers to overcome issues.
BetterFinger is a step in the direction of a more open and greatly improved clickpad experience (for Windows).

The project is not meant to be consumer-facing at the moment due to the difficulty in even installing a custom driver.

Successful initialization of the most advanced mode of Elan touchpads, allowing raw access to clickpad data.  The next step is to implement the algorithms around touch behavior, such as: two finger scrolling, dead zones, gestures, sensitivity adjustments, machine learning, etc.
